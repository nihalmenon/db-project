# ✈️ Travel Project

## 📖 Overview
This readme highlights the process of creating and loading a sample database using a travel user and trip dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## 🛠️ Steps
1. **Data Source**: The CSV data files were utilized to initialize the MySQL database.
2. **Data Schema**: Created a mock schema similar to the CSV to store data.
3. **Data Fetching**: The data was fetched using the `npm mysql` package for Node.js.
4. **Data Display**: Finally, the data is displayed through the React.js frontend interface.

## 🚀 Note
- This is not the exact data we are looking to use for the project.

This is what it looks like so far:
